        "\n",
        "This notebook uses [the TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) to train an SSD-MobileNet model or EfficientDet model with a custom dataset and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format. By working through this Colab, you'll be able to create and download a TFLite model that you can run on your PC, an Android phone, or an edge device like the Raspberry Pi.\n",

        "### Working in Colab\n",
        "Colab provides a virtual machine in your browser complete with a Linux OS, filesystem, Python environment, and best of all, a free GPU. It comes with most TensorFlow backend requirements (like CUDA and cuDNN) pre-installed. Simply click the play button on sections of code in this notebook to execute them on the virtual machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "> *Note: Make sure you're using a GPU-equipped machine by going to \"Runtime\" -> \"Change runtime type\" in the top menu bar, and then selecting \"GPU\" from the Hardware accelerator dropdown.*\n",
        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook uses TensorFlow 2. If you'd like to use TensorFlow 1, please see my [TF1 Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/Train_TFLite1_Object_Detection_Model.ipynb).\n",

        "### Navigation\n",
        "This is a long notebook! Each step of the training process has its own section. Click the arrow next to the heading for each section to expand it. You can use the table of contents in the left sidebar to jump from section to section."
